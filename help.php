     and services.<br><br>

Here are the types of personal information we collect:<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Information You Give Us:</b> We receive and store any information you provide in relation to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon Services. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our Amazon Services.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Automatic Information: </b>bWe automatically collect and store certain types of information<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about your use of Amazon Services, including information about your interaction with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;products, content, and services available through Amazon Services. Like many websites,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we use "cookies" and other unique identifiers, and we obtain certain types of information<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when your web browser or device accesses Amazon Services and other content served by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or on behalf of Amazon on other websites. Our physical stores may use cameras,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computer vision, sensors, and other technology to gather information about your activity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the store, such as the products and services you interact with. Click here to see<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;examples of what we collect.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Information from Other Sources:</b> We might receive information about you from other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sources, such as updated delivery and address information from our carriers, which we use<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to correct our records and deliver your next purchase more easily. Click here to see <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional examples of the information we receive.

  <a class="a_one">What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?</a>
  <p>
    to enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve<br>
     Amazon Services, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies<br>
      and how we use them, please read our Cookies Notice.
  </p>  <br> 
  <a class="a_one">Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</a>
  <p>
    if you choose to use Amazon Services, your use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this<br>
     Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes,<br>
      and application of the law of the state of Washington. If you have any concern about privacy <br>
      at Amazon, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our<br>
       business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change also. You should check our<br>
        websites frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice <br>
        applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the <br>
        promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to <br>
        make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent<br>
         of affected customers.
